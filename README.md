# Graph Algorithms Library

A Python library for working with graph structures and implementing various graph algorithms. The library provides a `Graph` class that allows users to create, manipulate, and analyze both directed and undirected graphs. Key features include:

- Representation of graphs using adjacency lists and matrices.
- Visualization of graphs using the `pyvis` library.
- Algorithms for finding Eulerian cycles, shortest paths, and solving the Chinese Postman problem.
- Support for weighted and unweighted graphs.

# How to use

The `Graph` class is inside the graph.py file. The other files show examples of how methods of the class can be used.
